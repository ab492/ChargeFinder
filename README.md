# Charge Finder

This is my current work in progress side project. It's going to be an mock app for finding nearby EV chargers and starting a charge.

> Inspired by [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up), this project is public but a working playground for me to learn. You can see my active daily notes to understand my progress [here](./working-notes/). Don't expect a fully finished and polished app.

The goals of this project are the following:
- To build a mock EV charging app that allows users to browse a list of charging stations and start a charge.
- To build a backend-for-frontend (BFF) while exploring Go.
- To build an iOS and Android app, powered by Kotlin Multiplatform and using Jetpack Compose for the Android app.
- To explore the OCPP protocol and create a mock implementation.

## Evolutionary Design
I'm using evolutionary design while building this. You can see my current progress [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLAoPVW4=/?moveToWidget=3458764612228008974&cot=14).
