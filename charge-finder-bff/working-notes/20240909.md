Gave up on getting documentation generating as it was slowing things down and really I want to get stuck into Kotlin Multiplatform. Contiueing today with moving the Kotlin backend over to Go. I'm not happy with using slug in some places and href in other; I'm going to move to use href everywhere for consistency.
