Back from holiday and finished looking into ViewModel and State in Compose. Finished the tutorial here: https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-viewmodel-and-state?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-basics-compose-unit-4-pathway-1%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-compose-viewmodel-and-state#11

Not sure which tutorial to pick up next but will start adding a view model layer to Charge Finder front end.

Started building Android view model. Got to this line: `val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsState()`. TBC...
