Got the charging station list displaying nicely on Android. I've added a loading screen and an error screen. It looks horrible atm as I've not thought about UI; I'm just focussing on how things fit together and work functionaly. Still trying to add tests but it's bloody hard - so many packages to use and configurations in Gradle. It's much easier in Xcode where you can easily add a test target.
