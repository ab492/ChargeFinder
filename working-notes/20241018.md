Got the charging station list displaying nicely on Android. I've added a loading screen and an error screen. It looks horrible atm as I've not thought about UI; I'm just focussing on how things fit together and work functionaly. Still trying to add tests but it's bloody hard - so many packages to use and configurations in Gradle. It's much easier in Xcode where you can easily add a test target.

Started to add the iOS app to keep the two platforms in sync. I'm working on the following iOS skills since I'm more familiar with iOS:
- TDD only (practicing some XP ideas)
- Swift Testing packages
- async/await

TODO next:
- Switch the API class to return a Result type.
- Look into sourcery for mocks. Can I set it up for a test?

Checked on StackOverflow about how to add tests and someone answered so I'm up and running (for Kotlin unit tests) ðŸ¥³!
