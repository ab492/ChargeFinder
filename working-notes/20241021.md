Looking into ResultType and don't think it's needed with async/await since it can return items and throw an error separately. 

I've been looking into Mint and Sourcery this morning so I can autogenerate mocks and try Sourcery out.

Mint is a command line tool package manager that lets you specify package versions and then run specific versions with `mint run` instead. Seems like a useful tool for managing project dependencies. Decided against using `mint bootstrap --link` so that each project can manage their own dependencies without affecting other projects.

Got AutoMockable working nicely and finished by view model tests. So far I've gone big on TDD and haven't even run the Xcode project yet, just the tests.
