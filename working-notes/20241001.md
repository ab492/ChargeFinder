Continued working on view model today. Basically spent my time working out which imports are required but it's building now. Will work on TDD for the view model now. Testing Codelab here: https://developer.android.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-basics#0

Will also need to look into LiveData (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) at some point.
Also look into app architecture here: https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture
