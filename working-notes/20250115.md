Spent the morning learning about NavigationStack. I wanted to be able to set the navigation as an enum in my view model so I could easily test it but that didn't seem as easy as I hoped. I could have used [SwiftNavigation](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-navigation#installation) but didn't want to overcomplicate things with a third party dependency just for displaying a detail screen. I could have also used `NavigationPath` in my view model, which I might re-assess when adding more destinations.
