Continuing to work on the error state based on https://levelup.gitconnected.com/error-handling-in-clean-architecture-using-flow-and-jetpack-compose-b39c729a68eb.

I've added this for modelling my state:

```kotlin
sealed class UiState<T> {
    class Loading<T>: UiState<T>()
    data class Error<T>(val error: String) : UiState<T>()
    data class Loaded<T>(val data: T): UiState<T>()
} 
```

Working well so far. I spend this morning getting my list view appearing and adding loading spinner and error state. I'm starting to use coloured background to understand how each composable fits together.

Next: keep working on breaking up the composables, adding proper previews, then look into scaffold.
