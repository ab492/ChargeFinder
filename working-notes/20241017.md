Continuing to work on the error state based on https://levelup.gitconnected.com/error-handling-in-clean-architecture-using-flow-and-jetpack-compose-b39c729a68eb.

A nice thing that I could try in the future is this for modeling ui state:

```kotlin
sealed class UiState<T> {
    class Loading<T>: UiState<T>()
    data class Error<T>(val error: String) : UiState<T>()
    data class Loaded<T>(val data: T): UiState<T>()
} 
```

I'll leave mine simpler for the moment but might come back to it.
