Picking things back up after a week off. Got Proxyman debugging working nicely on emulator and built a basic error page.

Next: How to present the error page (https://levelup.gitconnected.com/error-handling-in-clean-architecture-using-flow-and-jetpack-compose-b39c729a68eb), finish looking into scaffold.

After that: proper previews and passing a page title from the backend (or at least record that I want to do that somewhere.)
