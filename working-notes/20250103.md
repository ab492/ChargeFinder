Picking this project back up again after a couple of months working on TDD skills and [Testing Tools](https://github.com/ab492/TestingTools).

Spent the morning:
- Debugging why the API no longer worked. It did, I had just changed a setting in PAW.
- Refreshing where I left off and starting to introduce evolutionary design to track my progress.
- Add script for running tests so I can start to introduce better CI/CD.
