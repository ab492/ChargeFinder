A Kotlin backend was too heavy duty for my needs as it had too many memory requirements. I didn't fancy spending time debugging memory problems so I've switched to Go to learn a different language that's common for backend work. Spent the last couple of weeks learning the basics of Go and will start re-writing my BFF API in Go today.
