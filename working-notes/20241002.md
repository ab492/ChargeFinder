Tried working through  https://developer.android.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-basics#2 but the starter project wouldn't run which killed the flow a bit.

Ran through this example instead before adding tests to my own project:
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-run-tests.html#work-with-more-complex-projects

Having Gradle issues again. I'm sure it's great when you fully understand everything but the learning curve is steep.
