Worked through https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-basics#11 to learn about themes. Blew through it for the moment to get a rough idea but will revisit once I'm thinking more about UI.

I built a basic list item and list view for static data. Now I'm starting to think about how to structure my data fetches. I have the API calls but I need a layer that fetches the API data and transfers it into something more familiar like a view model. This should also be multiplatform and only handed to SwiftUI at the latest point possible. It's making me think I've overcomplicated the BFF for this initial demo. I've added an initial fetch for the pages, which contains the data to fetch the subsequent pages:
http://bramblytech.co.uk/pages <- contains information for fetching home and any other pages
http://bramblytech.co.uk/pages/home
http://bramblytech.co.uk/pages/chargingStationDetail/:id

I think that's overengineered for my current problem. I know I have two pages: home and detail. I should just fetch them and worry about additional pages when I'm ready. Keep things as simple as they need to be to solve the problem. I won't delete /pages just yet, but will experiment with ditching it.

Think I want to move onto this one next to learn about app architecture: https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-compose-unit-4-pathway-1
