Removed the /getPages endpoint in favour of having two endpoints:
- home
- detail

While I initially wanted the tabs to be driven by a get pages endpoint which would pass the URLs and page type for the other pages (home and detail), I think it's massively overkill for a demo project. Especially when I'm new to Kotlin and Android! I'm going with the simplest solution possible now.
