Gave up on getting documentation generating as it was slowing things down and really I want to get stuck into Kotlin Multiplatform. Continuing today with moving the Kotlin backend over to Go. I'm not happy with using slug in some places and href in other; I'm going to move to use href everywhere for consistency. Got the following endpoints working in rough form:
- /pages
- /pages/home
- /pages/chargingStationDetail/:id

Worked on re-integrating new backend into barebones apps. Very happy I've got my backend deployment script working well - it makes development very fast and allows me to quickly iterate the backend models.
