Spent the morning tidying up the UI for the list. Looks terrible atm as trying to focus on the setup first. Will move onto navigation next.

Tried to get previews working with view model but it was a lot of faff. Using @MainActor for the view model seemed to cause all kinds of issues, so I need to do some further reading there.
